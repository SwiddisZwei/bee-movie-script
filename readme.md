# There are so many copies of the _Bee Movie_ script out there. Why are you doing this?

I did a little research. All the scripts I found were seemingly copied from [https://web.njit.edu/~cm395/theBeeMovieScript/]. Maybe that one came from somewhere else too, but either way, they're all the same. So why not use that one?

Well, it's a low-quality copy. You can tell if your script was (probably) copied from the same seed and left unedited by searching for the text "Ooming", which should read "Coming". There are numerous typos, some of which seem to indicate that the script was produced via OCR from subtitles (capital C becoming O quite frequently, for example). My quest for this repo is to provide the highest-quality version(s) of the script of the _Bee Movie_ available on the internet.
